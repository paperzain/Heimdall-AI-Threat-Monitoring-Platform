# Heimdal | AI Threat Monitoring Platform
Heimdall is an AI-powered threat monitoring system that classifies live network traffic in real time using machine learning. It streams packet data via Apache Kafka, applies adaptive models to detect malicious activity, and visualizes results through a Flask-based dashboard, continuously improving through incremental retraining.
